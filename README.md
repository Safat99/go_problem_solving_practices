## prob 5

```
a^2 + b = n
a + b^2 = m

1<= n,m <=1000
```
Applied brute force tech for finding the number (a,b) pair of integers


## prob6
finding the lexicographic largest palindromic subsequence

---
**lexicographical order:**  The order that dictionary follows.
like amorphous > abscond

**subsequence:** : a special substring which will maintain order and can remove any element inside the original string... like `racecar` to `rr` or `racr`
